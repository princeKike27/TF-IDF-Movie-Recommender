# TF-IDF-Movie-Recommender

For this project I created a python Web App that uses a TF-IDF model of the genres and keywords of movies and cosine similarity, that measures the similarity between two non-zero vectors, to recommend five movies to the user, given a movie the user likes. For this task, I'm going to use a dataset from TMDB (The Movie Database) that contains 5000 movies, with their respective genres and keywords, between the year 1916 to 2017. 


Throughout the project you will be able to find:

* Data cleaning and standardization.
* Creation of Vocabulary and Term-Frequency Matrices.
* TF-IDF Model.
* Cosine Similarity between Movies.
* Web Application.
